For certain issues, the result was immediate, while others took several weeks to manifest. It is incredible to witness all the changes that entered my life after the sessions.

It was amazing to watch her work with Sid and it was even more incredible to see the results several days later. Sid's condition gradually returned to normal: his energy was back.

      "title": "Emotion, Body & Belief",
      "titleItalic": "Code",
      "intro": "Emotion Code, Body Code and Belief Code are globally established energy healing methods developed since the 1990s by Dr. Bradley Nelson and his team in the USA.",
      "intro2": "The Codes allow us to work with the deepest layers of your being — those that know they need help and, above all, what kind of help they require.",
      "intro3": "My role is to ask the right questions, receive the answers, and act according to the guidance that comes through, releasing from your field, body, and mind whatever is creating imbalance. In this way, we address and heal the root cause of your issue.",
      "intro4": "When your energetic blueprint comes into alignment, your physical body naturally heals.",
      "subtitle": "What can the Codes do for you?",
      "emotionCode": {
        "title": "EMOTION CODE",
        "description": "The EMOTION CODE performs a deep cleansing of the repressed emotions you unconsciously carry with you. This emotional baggage comes from old or recent wounds and traumas, it can be inherited or absorbed from others, and it continuously affects your mental state and physical health. It is estimated that around 80% of energetic imbalances in human beings are caused by unprocessed emotions.",
        "benefit": "Receiving an Emotion Code session is like finally releasing a heavy backpack you've been carrying for a long time, allowing your whole being to straighten, breathe, and heal."

        "title": "BODY CODE",
        "description": "The BODY CODE corrects a multitude of energetic imbalances in your body and mind, promoting overall harmonization of your organism at all levels. A balanced, energetically clean body is capable of performing powerful healing processes and regeneration.",
        "benefit": "A Body Code session is like thoroughly cleaning and organizing a room, allowing fresh air to circulate again!"
      },
      "beliefCode": {
        "title": "BELIEF CODE",
        "description": "The BELIEF CODE reprograms negative subconscious beliefs that limit your thoughts, feelings, and actions. When these mental programs are neutralized together with the trauma that created them, subconscious blocks dissolve and a new path opens in your life. Once you align your subconscious truth (the inner programming) with your conscious will (what you truly want in life), you can finally guide your life in the right direction.",
        "benefit": "A Belief Code session is like weeding the garden of your mind and allowing healthy thought patterns to take root, which then reflect naturally in your daily feelings and actions."

      "title": "Past Life",
      "titleItalic": "Regressions",
      "intro": "Past life regressions allow you to regain memories of a previous existence that are still impacting your present life.",
      "paragraph1": "Many of us suffer from traumas that haven't been caused by anything in our present life and seek healing. During a regression, we bring these old wounds into awareness and work constructively with them until the trauma is processed and released.",
      "paragraph2": "Additionally, many people undergo past life regressions simply to remember who they once were and how it can aid them in their current life. This is how past-life regressions serve as a wonderful accelerator for your spiritual growth.",
      "onlineTitle": "If my office is far from where you live, an online session is a convenient alternative.",
      "onlineDescription": "It reduces the time and cost of travel and gives you the opportunity to enjoy the experience in the comfort and privacy of your home.",
      "onlineEffective": "An online regression is equally effective as one conducted in person. All you need is a quiet, dimly lit room, headphones with a good microphone, and a stable internet connection."

      "title": "Ilyari: Embodied Light",
      "titleItalic": "Transmission",
      "intro": "Ilyari is a unique personal healing modality that flows through me as spontaneous body movement.",
      "paragraph1": "As the healing lightcodes flow through my channel, the body movements distribute them where they are needed most: whether to ease your physical symptom, release emotional stagnation, or recalibrate and upgrade your entire energy field into greater harmony.",
      "paragraph2": "These transmissions are deeply felt and intuitively guided. Not choreographed, not rehearsed, but received in the moment as a direct transmission of light.",
      "lineagesIntro": "The healing you receive through Ilyari is woven from star lineages braided through my soul stream, expressed as a unique movement dialect. It carries the frequencies of:",

      },
      "sessionsTitle": "Ilyari sessions",
      "sessionsDescription": "Each Ilyari session is a live, channeled transmission of healing light that unfolds in its own timing. Most sessions last 20–30 minutes and conclude naturally when the energetic work is complete.",
      "sessionsNote": "If more healing is called for beyond that point, I seal the field with the appropriate codes, and we'll explore next steps together (such as continuing the process in a follow-up session)."
